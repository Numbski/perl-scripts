=head1 NAME

Device::USB::MissileLauncher - interface to toy USB missile launchers

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Device::USB::MissileLauncher;
  my $ml = Device::USB::MissileLauncher->new();
  $ml->do('left');
  $ml->do('up');
  $ml->do('fire');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This implements a basic interface to the toy USB missile launchers that were on sale
in Marks and Spencers Christmas 2005 and later at 'I want one of those'. 

It has two methods - new() and do(). do() takes a string out of the following list.

  stop
  left
  right
  up
  down
  leftup
  rightup
  leftdown
  rightdown
  fire

=head1 THANKS

Ian Jeffray published some C code to work with the Missile Launcher at 
http://ian.jeffray.co.uk/linux/ and Scott Weston published some Python
code at http://scott.weston.id.au/software/pymissile-20060126/ , both
sets of code helped a lot when I was working out how to control the toy.

Jonathan Stowe also helped with the debugging to get v0.03 out, he spotted
the C code sending the init strings everytime.
