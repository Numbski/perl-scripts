  14 lines Perl code needs very detailed commenting as well as what overall function is of the file.

There is already comments for every 1-2 lines of code.

WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE:
1. I want to get these 14 lines of Perl code commented again and more detailed
since it is my impression that extra code has been inserted into the file after the commenting.

2. Want to get detailed review what is the purpose/action of the file with code. 

2.1) Especially am interested in knowing ift this file is to be used for - or could be used for - easily
- to open a VPN connection

2.2) If the code intention is to evade or hide in case that some specific circumstance occur/does not occur.
If so, in what circmstances will the code do/not do the action - and what action is it it will do/or not do?

2.3) What does this mean in realitity - and is this normal:
"Exit immediately for every certificate depth other than 0."
exit 0 unless ($DEPTH eq "0");

2.4) Why does the code do this below - and is that normal legit action:
# Strip the CN from the X509 identifier.
$CN =~ /\/CN=(.*)$/i;
$CN = $1;

2.5) Is this "confighash" normal to have in such application?
Ifr so, why is the information then stored in a hash file instead of a normal configuration file?
my %confighash = ();
if (-f "${General::swroot}/ovpn/ovpnconfig"){
	&General::readhasharray("${General::swroot}/ovpn/ovpnconfig", \%confighash);
	foreach my $key (keys %confighash) {
		my $cn = $confighash{$key}[2];

2.51) is the purpose of the "confighash" to read information (password or similar) that should not be read at all (by this file)?

2.51) What is the purpose of the command "SWROOT" - and what does it do/allow/action taken being there?
if (-f "${General::swroot}/ovpn/ovpnconfig"){

2.6)  Why does the code "strip" the "CN" from the X509 Identifier?
# Strip the CN from the X509 identifier.
$CN =~ /\/CN=(.*)$/i;
$CN = $1;


if (-f "${General::swroot}/ovpn/ovpnconfig"){
2.61) What does the "$CN" do as a command as such? is that normal?


2.7)  Does this code load a different version of the program or a different file depending upon if it sees the VPN connection as already being used or that code alrady being used? if not, what does this part do?
# Skip disabled connections.
		next unless ($confighash{$key}[0] eq "on");

		# Skip non-roadwarrior connections.
		next unless ($confighash{$key}[3] eq "host");

this file was extracted from the opensource app http://www.ipfire.org and it  is my impression that this file has been tampered with - along with other files.

SPECS BELOW DO **NOT** NEED TO BE ANSWERED - BUT IF YOU DO ANSWER THEM - DETAILED - THEN you get
 $25 EXTRA in bonus. 
    You would need to download the 102 MB ISO file from http://www.ipfire.org and extract the files in order to answer the questions below.

2.8) There is a file called "VMLinuz" that seems to start booting this program. I would like to have this file extracted so can see the code. The vmlinuz file doesnt need to be analuyzd/commented - but do extract it for me - and let me know if this is normal that all Linux programs uses a "VMLinuz" file to boot the programs and Operating system with?


2.9) When program starts then sometimes it runs with "Runlevel 3" and sometimes with "Runlevel 6".
Whivh folder and/or file name would contain the commands/code that determines what "runlevel"
that it should run?

2.91) What application/program do I need to use in order to extract/open that file?

2.92) What application/program dp i need to use in order to extract/open the file VMLinuz to see
inside the code?

2.93) What other code files influences on "INITRD" file when booting? Which folder(s) are they located?

2.94) Download www.ipfire.org ISO file and extract it - then answer:
What files are being used when booting the ipfire app? Write a list of the first 10 files and their folders.

==============
Please write why you are the right coder for this project and what related experienced you have with perl code and commenting perl code as well as how many years?

thanks
